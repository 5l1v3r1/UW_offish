Offline passwords collector POC for testing purposes

UW_offish is a single-threaded clear text protocol simulator. It listens on a
number of ports, and sends lines of data as it receives others, according to a
simple configuration file.

It may be useful on a fake open wireless access point. Combined with a protocol
analyzer, redirecting all traffic to this program could attract passwords from
unaware users, looking for an actual internet access in the wild. Another
possible use would involve honeypots, as it could attract attacks while avoiding
actual exploitation (hopefully).


The current state is:
- listening: OK
- configuration file loading: OK
- read/write: OK
- transparent proxies support: NO


The planned or possible features are:
- protocol definition framework (with password detection)
- fuzzing
